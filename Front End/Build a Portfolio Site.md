# For Reviewers

## How Grading Works

We have created a document that gives rubric specific instructions to help you grade this project.You can access the document here: [Build a Portfolio Site - Best Practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TMTRhrm7Boz1uic9Ji5zfhu-QtimaxVMKqPdVldr-8A/pub)

It is VERY IMPORTANT that you read this document before you begin evaluating projects. Every review must follow the guidelines in this document.

# Project Overview

![Project Roadmap](http://i.imgur.com/MtxM7by.jpg)

## Project Overview 
You will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete through the course of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree.

Once you've successfully replicated the design mockup, you are encouraged to continue tweaking and making customizations to the design to personalize it and make it your own!

##Note
If you have successfully completed the project for the Intro to HTML and CSS course in the past (which entails having graduated from the course and having access to your course certificate), simply email us at frontend-project@udacity.com with your passing evaluation and we'll give you credit for this project.

## Why this Project?
The first thing potential employers look for isn’t which school you attended or what your GPA was; they want to see what you’ve built! You need a professional portfolio to show off your skills.

In this project you’ll build a great look portfolio where you can show off images, descriptions and link to all of your projects. You'll do so writing code that conforms to the [Udacity Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/).

## What will I learn?
You will learn how HTML is used to define the content of a web page and start to think of every web page as a number of boxes on the screen. You’ll then learn how to position those boxes and make them beautiful using CSS.

You'll accomplish this while conforming to a [style guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/) which is an important constraint once you step into any existing development position.

## Why is this Important to my Career?

* Without a portfolio, recruiters won’t even look at your resume much less interview you.
* At their very foundation, web applications are just content delivery mechanisms; HTML defines how that language is structured.
* Reading poorly designed content is never an enjoyable experience; CSS empowers you to create beautiful content regardless of your user’s device.

# Project Details

## How do I Complete this Project?
This project is connected to the [Intro to HTML and CSS course](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud304-nd) but depending on your background knowledge of HTML and CSS you may not need to take the entire course to complete this project. Here's what you should do:

1. Download the [design mockup file](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/p1.pdf). Note that the color swatches on the left are for color reference only. They are not part of the design.
2. Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.
3. Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
4. Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.
5. Validate your HTML and CSS against the [W3C's Validators](http://validator.w3.org/). See Useful Links below. *Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:*

- HTML5: **Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta** when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.

- CSS3: **Property *[some property here]* is an unknown vendor extension** when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box-sizing).

- CSS3: **Value Error: *[some property here]* Parse Error calc...**.
