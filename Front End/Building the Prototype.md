### Project Overview

Great job on finishing the problem set! Are you starting to feel like a web developer yet? You should!

Before you move on, I have one more challenge. I want you to use what you've learned up to this point to complete the following project. Simply titled, "Building the Prototype", this project combines the skills you mastered in the problem set and asks you to recreate a webpage from a design prototype.

This is a common workflow for front-end web developers. Typically, you'll be provided with a design protoype that needs to be translated to an actual, functional website. In most cases, designers **ONLY** provide you with the design prototype. However, for this project, I've provided you with the design prototype and the HTML. The design prototype used in this project is inspired by trading cards and features a fish you might recognize from a Disney animated film.

### Project Instructions

0. Download and unzip `building-the-prototype.zip` from the downloadables section. Inside, you'll find `card.html` (the HTML), `clownfish.jpg`, and the design prototype.
1. To complete the project, open `card.html` and add the proper CSS to recreate the design prototype. You'll need to modify the HTML to include attributes and use class selectors to specify the elements you want to style.
2. The card should at least include:
    - a border around the animal's name, image, and details
    - a border around the animal's details
    - spacing between the animal's name, image, and details (you will need to the property padding, [read more about it here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding))
    - bolded labels for animal notes (e.g. 'Habitat')
    - italicized text for interesting fact about animal
    - the use of Roboto font
3. When you're done matching the HTML and CSS to the design prototype, swap in a picture and description of your favorite animal.

### Project Submission

* Once your satisfied with your result, check your project against the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ijBxKqQ46zixDbHm4rGXKHOGR0Km-KXvjFmlYZsa9HE/pub) to make sure you've satisfied all requirements.
* Create a zip file containing `card.html` and your new animal image (unless you linked directly to the image).
* Submit your project to be reviewed.

Have fun and be creative 🐠 🐍 🐅 🐼 🐫! Writing CSS isn't an exact science, so feel free to experiment. Your submission should resemble the design prototype, but it's okay if it doesn't match exactly, so long as you satisfy all the requirements.
