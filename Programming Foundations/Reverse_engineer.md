# Reverse Engineering Project Specification for Reviewers

This project involves students analyzing the Project Compass Web app.

They will take lessons that involve learning concepts about:

+ Front end programming
+ Back end programming
+ Mobile programming
+ Data Analysis

In the assignment students are asked to answer 10 questions and provide and explanation. The answer must be correct and have an explanation for the question to be counted toward meeting specifications. Because answers may be subjective, focus only on whether the answer is correct and if there is an explanation. Students need to answer all 10 questions correctly with an explanation to meet specifications.

They do not necessary have to demonstrate their knowledge with computer code, but they certainly can demonstrate their knowledge with their code by manipulating the original Project Compass web app HTML, CSS, or JavaScript to  exceeds specifications on the project.

Reviewer Instructions for Stage 5

1. View student’s answers.html file

The file you receive from students, when unzipped, should contain a file called answers.html

The top of the file should look something like this:

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">

  <h1 class="title"> Project <img class="compass_icon"src="img/compass.svg"> Compass</h1>
  <h1 class="title">Reverse Engineering Project</h1>
  <div id= "wrapper">```

You should go to the `<!--Student Answer Section-->` or open answers.html in a browser to read the student's answers.

I suspect most submissions will meet specifications. This stage is intentionally easy.

4. Write Feedback

If the project does not meet expectations in any of the rubric categories please be very specific about what the student needs to do to pass their next next submission. Also please read through their notes and if the student shows confusion or is inaccurate, please guide the student to the correct information, either through linking or explaining.

If the project meets expectations, congratulate the student! They've come a long way.
