##Project Overview

In Stage 1, you designed and planned your Capstone app. Now, it's time to build it!  

**Nanodegree students must successfully complete the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd801/l-4041218607/m-4280888865" target="_blank">Capstone, Stage 1</a> project prior to beginning Stage 2.** 

## Why this Project?

In this project, you will demonstrate the skills you've learned in your Nanodegree journey, and apply them to creating a unique app experience of your own. By the end of this project, you will have an app that you can submit to the Google Play Store for distribution.

## What Will I Learn?

The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full development cycle of an app.

## Submission and Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to the rubric in the previous node. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

**Note**:  Please make sure you **clean** your project before creating a zip file or pushing code to a GitHub repository. You can clean your project by following the instructions given in **[this](https://goo.gl/8lgeV5)** link.

If you are using GitHub to host your projects, please make sure the code you want to submit for review is in the **master** branch of your repository.

**IMPORTANT: If you're submitting via a public Github repository, please make sure any external API key that you utilize, has been removed from your code.**  It's highly unsafe (and often breaks the Terms of Service) to include API keys in public repos, so you need to remove yours. You can add a note in a README file where a reviewer should go to insert their API key. Reviewers have been trained to expect this situation.

When you're ready to submit your project, click on Udacity in the navigation bar at the top your screen to return to your Udacity Home. Then, locate and expand the project you'd like to submit. Click on the button to submit your project. You can view the submission process in more detail <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfMGTlUxxkcZM6iRXbVZ45vPPZGRD4qEp3ENBGSmZ_o/pub?embedded=true" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you have any problems submitting your project, please email us at **android-project@udacity.com**. Due to the high volume of submissions, the turnaround for your project can take **up to a week**.

Each Android ND project will be reviewed against the<a href="http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html" target="_blank"> Common Project Requirements</a>, in addition to its project-specific rubric.
