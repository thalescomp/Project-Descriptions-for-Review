# Project 5: Capstone Project
## Healthcare Track

The **Healthcare Track** Capstone Project is part of a number of suggested areas of research for the final project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. Below you will find a collection of materials, datasets, and potential problems in the domain available for you to investigate. These resources are non-exhaustive and you are free to pursue your own research beyond what is provided. Before you begin, be sure that you are familiar with the [Capstone Project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/108/view), the [Capstone Project description](https://github.com/udacity/Project-Descriptions-for-Review/blob/master/Machine-Learning/Capstone%20Project.md), and the [project report template](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/capstone/project_report_template.md). These resources will be necessary to complete the Capstone Project, regardless of which domain or problem you choose to work on.
