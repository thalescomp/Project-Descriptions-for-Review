# Set Up Your Development Environment

## Project Overview

Congratulations! You’re on your way to become a Rails developer, and the first step is setting up your development environment. Your first project is designed to show that you’ve successfully setup your dev environment, by successfully creating a scaffolded Rails to-do list application.

Your to-do list app should allow the user to create, read, update, and destroy to-do items in the browser.

Afterwards, you’ll take a step back and reflect on your goals, worries, strengths, and motivation for learning Rails development. You will have the opportunity to get valuable feedback from our project reviewers!

## Completing this Project

* **File Requirements**: For this project, you will need Rails successfully installed on your computer. You can check the version of Rails you’re running with the command:

```
rails -v
```

Here are the Rails commands that you will need for this project:
* `rails new` to create a new Rails application project
* `rails generate scaffold` (followed by the resource name and attribute fields) to create a scaffolded to-do list application
* `rake db:migrate` to migrate the database
* `rails server` to run your application
* `rake routes` (optional) to view the routes available in your application

Use `rake routes` to see the list of routes for your to-do application, and add at least one task to your to-do list.

* **Reflections.txt**: There should also be a `reflections.txt` that contains your reflections on this project. Your `reflections.txt` will have three parts:
  * GOALS: What are your goals as a developer? These goals can be project goals, career goals, or personal goals.
  * TRANSFERRABLE SKILLS: What are at least two transferrable skills or pieces of knowledge from your prior experience that will assist you in overcoming challenges in this Nanodegree program and achieving your goals?
  * QUESTIONS: What are at least two questions you have about the process of becoming a Rails developer?
