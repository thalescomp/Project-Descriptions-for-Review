#### What is the core function of your team? What is the core function of your company or organizational unit? Is the core function of your team well aligned with the function of the larger organizational unit or the company as a whole?

Replace this entire text with your answer. The *core function* of a team is the one clearly stated objective around which the team is organized. A team may have several different responsibilities. For example, an IT team might both provide end-user support and maintain infrastructure such as file servers. But the core function of the team might be something like "ensuring all employees have the IT tools and resources they need to do their jobs efficiently". 

To take another example, if you work at a company that sells shoes, these might be the core functions at various levels: 

* Team: developing the software to sell shoes online
* Organizational unit: handling all matters related to selling shoes online
* Company-wide: selling shoes

#### Who are your team's customers? Are they internal or external? What do they need?

Replace this entire text with your answer. Continuing with the shoe selling example, the software development team has both external and internal customers. 

* External: the customer purchasing the shoes
* Internal: the warehouse staff who need to fulfill the orders and maintain inventory.

There might be other internal customers as well, such as the accounting department. Any stakeholder who needs some functionality from the software product counts as a customer. 

#### What are all the internal teams or people that are involved in a product release, from start to finish? 

Replace this entire text with your answer. Include the project and product managers, the developers, the operations team, sales, marketing: any team that influences the process or outcome.

#### What is the current flow of software development and delivery in your team? List the main steps and whether they are manual or automated. 

Replace this entire text with your answer. Steps might include:

* Specifying desired functionality
* Assessing user requirements
* Coding the application

and so on. 

#### How would you characterize communication within the organization? Do team members communicate well with each other? Is communication across teams smooth? How would you improve communication? 

Replace this entire text with your answer. Consider such questions as:

* Does the company or team face any problems that would be avoided with better communication?
* Are both developers and operations involved when starting a new project? Do developers receive and act upon feedback from operations regarding how the software is performing?
* How do internal customers make their requirements known? Do they directly communicate with the developers?
